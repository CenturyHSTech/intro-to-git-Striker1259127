# Git Review

## Git in My Words

In my words, I think Git is a great way to collaborate with many people at once because of its many features and its capabilities. One example of this can be of working on a autopilor project. One person an clone a file and work on it seperately and then add a pull to the github, making it easier to look at and work on it for multiple people.

## What I am curious about

For me, there are quite a few things I am very curious about. One of those things that I am very curious about is pushing and commiting to the github. Last year, I had joined Github brcause I was part of the Game Design club. The only time I really used Github was mainly for adding basic models to the game we were working on. Now I want to know what it means. Another thing is pulling to the github. Pulling to the github was another thing that I was very curious about. Many other people were also working and pulling to the github and I was also curious about that so I want to learn that too.
