    <h1>Is Working Alone Better Than Working Together?</h1>
    <p>
        Now you may be wondering if working with your friends is more productive than working alone. Well fear now because I can answer those concerns. In all reality, it depends wether working alone is better or not so for now, letds look at the positives of working together. Now some positives of working together is that you have more company of your peers. This can increase your overall morale and makes your peers more happy as well. Another thing that can be seen when working together is an increase in unique ideas. With one person, the amount of ideas shared in very limited, but with a group of people, those ideas can be easily passed from pne person to another.

        Those were all the positives, but there are some positives of working alone as well. With working alone, you have more conterol over your work instead of going by other people's choices and rarely your choice. This can be really useful in some very intensive work. Another thing in working alone is that working alone is very flexible and based on your schedule instead of catching up to or waiting for other people to finish stuff within the project. Well therte you have it. These are all of the main things that makes working together and working alone so similar, yet so different all at the same time.

        Just as an extra, these are fom what I have found throughot the web. Not all the time working together can be very positive. It depends on the type of task and what you are doing.
